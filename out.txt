Answers will vary. When Krakauer puts the flag from Qomolangma into the mountain in Antarctica, he is succeeding after a significant failure.

So he probably feels very happy to be enjoying climbing again, and to have had a safe and successful expedition with his team in Antarctica.

Because HA Schult wants to remind us that people produce garbage and sometimes people are a kind of garbage. By making those “trash people,” Schult is asking us to think about the trash problem facing our planet today.

I was in my house and had no time to escape. I ran with my son into a closet.
I did think I might die. I couldn’t breathe because I inhaled so much dirt and dust. Then the tornado suddenly lifted me into the air where I could breathe.
My house was destroyed and I was thrown into the air. I can’t believe a person can survive that, but I did.
